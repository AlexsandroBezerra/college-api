  Javascript API for college project
</h2>

[:brazil: Vers√£o em portugu√™s](.github/README-PT.md)

## üíÅ About the project

A Rest API that provides everything professors need to gamify student tasks. Built with Javascript, this API uses [Express](https://expressjs.com), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and other libraries to facilitate the development speed, and maintenance of the code. Initially, it uses SQLite as its main database. This repository is just a college project :)
